## 🛠️ Advanced GitHub Features Leveraged

To manage the organization efficiently and prevent API rate-limiting while maintaining strict security, we utilize the following native features:

1. **Repository Dispatches (Event Framework):**
   - Instead of polling git repos for changes, `vault-manager` emits a `repository_dispatch` to `container-manager` on specific triggers, ensuring a push-based build chain.
2. **Organization-wide Repository Rulesets:**
   - Unified branch protection rules are applied org-wide (blocking force-pushes and deletions on `main` branches) to enforce codebase safety.
3. **GitHub Container Registry (GHCR):**
   - Hosting custom OCI images compiled by our `container-manager` builders directly within the organization package registry.
4. **Self-Hosted Runner Fleet:**
   - Deployed on dedicated infrastructure (`llmadmin` heavy/lite and `t430` medium/lite pools) with custom security configurations (`no-new-privileges:true`) and local caching (apt-cache, ccache).
5. **Secret Scanning & Dependabot Alerts:**
   - Continuous scanning of codebases for credential leaks and automated package upgrade PR generation.
